# BITSHYD-Hackathon

The business feasibility of this cloud security project is strong due to the increasing use of digital infrastructure in schools and universities and the growing threats of cyberattacks. Educational institutions handle large amounts of sensitive data, making security a top priority. Our solution includes a subscription-based SaaS model, one-time licensing with maintenance, and custom security solutions, ensuring recurring revenue and scalability. Integrating blockchain with academic record management enhances security and transparency, making records tamper-proof. AI-based threat detection and biometric authentication improve cybersecurity by strengthening access control and identifying threats in real time. Regular security audits help institutions stay ahead of emerging cyber threats. With its specialized focus, scalable design, and compliance with regulations, this project offers a reliable security framework tailored for educational institutions. By providing flexible pricing and forming strategic partnerships, it has the potential to become a leading cloud security solution, ensuring data protection and reliability.
